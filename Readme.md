# Foxhole mapmaker

This thing reads [Foxhole WarAPI](https://github.com/clapfoot/warapi) and spits out the world map image with all the icons on it.

Given the existence of [Foxholestats](https://foxholestats.com/), the use-case for the current tool is extremely narrow - documenting the resource distribution and starting conditions in a way that would be suitable for upload to the [Foxhole Wiki](https://foxhole.wiki.gg). The output is a hand-crafted SVG as it allows for good compression of the terrain images, while retaining crisp and readable icons, all while staying well under the wiki's filesize limit of 10MB.

This is a weekend project, not really intended for production or any wide publicity, it only exists on github for reference and posterity.
